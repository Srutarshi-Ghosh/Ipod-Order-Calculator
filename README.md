Ipod Ordering Problem


IPOD Inventory

There is a company which have started selling the ipods ONLINE . But they want to sell these ipods online at best price.

i) They have ipod Inventories at Brazil and Argentina. Each of the inventory can store only 100 ipods.

ii) ipods at Brazil are sold at 100$/unit  and at Argentina they are sold at 50$/unit.

iii) after every order the stock at both brazil and argentina inventories are again back to 100 units.

iv) the no of ipods ordered should be only in multiple of 10.(i.e no of ipods ordered shouldnt be im number like 123 etc. )

v) the order placed should be either fullfilled completely or nothing

vi) if the order is placed like 120 ipods from brazil then the remaining ipods can be brought from the other inventory i.e.argentina.

but here shipping price of 400$ per 10 units is applied.

they have also given the 4 set of inputs and outputs which your program should produce

:
: :
i) Brazil : 5

500 : 95 : 100

ii) Brazil : 50

4500 : 100 : 50

(this trick here is u first have to calculate the cost prize at both brazil and argentina..and d one which is low should be given..here argentina)

iii) Argentina : 120

7800 : 80 :0

iv) Argentina : 250

Out of stock!!!!
